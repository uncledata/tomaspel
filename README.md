### Hello!
I'm Tomas - I think of my self as a data professional. 

Started as Marketing manager then moved to internship as Business Analyst I quickly understood that the most exciting part
of my work - write complex SQL queries. Changed my job to small consulting company in which I was one man team which opened my eyes.
I like more pipelining and data infra than analysing data. 

__Have experience of multiple technologies:__
* Python - from automating simple repetitive things to some 
  Data Science experimentation
* Apache Spark - made some internal course to cover basics and a bit 
of performance related matters, spark UI
* MSSQL (2008, 2012) SSAS/SSIS/SSRS/SSMS
* and many others, but to smaller scale (PoC, testing out and etc.)

__I have quite deep knowledge on data modeling topics:__
* Star/Snowflake Schema
* Data Vault

Have created a basic guide for people [Guide to Datawarehousing](https://towardsdatascience.com/guide-to-data-warehousing-6fdcf30b6fbe)
which covers my mentioned approaches + data lake + lake house to some extent.

On some regularity I'm writing more things on [Medium](http://tomaspeluritis.medium.com), you can follow me there or follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaspeluritis/).
